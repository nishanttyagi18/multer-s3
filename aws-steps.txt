- Go to S3 and create a bucket (change region and other things as default)
- Go to IAM 
- First create a policy so we are not giving many access to our application
- Create new policy > Choose a service > S3 > In actions (getObject, putObject, deleteObject, getObjectAttribute)
> In Resources (add arn with bucket name and *)
- Not go to users and create one > In permissions attach existing policy created in previous step
